# Capital Bikeshare Visualizer

Visualizes bike trips from [Capital Bikeshare](http://www.capitalbikeshare.com), using [Capital-Bikeshare-API](https://github.com/MiniCodeMonkey/Capital-Bikeshare-API) for data.

This is a simple html/css/js web app with no server-side component.

## Using

* Set up and configure [Capital-Bikeshare-API](https://github.com/MiniCodeMonkey/Capital-Bikeshare-API)
* Update the `BASE_URL` variable in `js/map.js` to point to the URL where you set up the API.
* You're good to go!

## Notes

This app used to be available on a public website, but unfortunately it had to be taken down by request of Alta Bikeshare / Capital Bikeshare due to conflicts with their [Terms of Use](http://www.capitalbikeshare.com/terms-of-use). (You are not allowed to share your credentials with a third-party). -- Which is fully understandable and fair.

So for now, please run this locally in a non-public location.
